-In private mode, the browser doesn't track history.
-Doesn't track cookies.

I feel the private mode or incognito mode is a good way to test because everytime you 
go in to a website its a new person per say. If cookie were being track then they would
know what ads to show and populated on websites you go to. With out this mode its like 
you are one step behind because it already know what to show you.
